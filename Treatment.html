</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Beginning." tags="" position="501,277">Pip watched the small neighborhood patrol go down the street. Every week, four of the adults are allowed to take off from work to instead protect the village. As far as Pip can tell, this mostly means marching up and down the street with clubs or standing at the cordons at either end of the street to deny or permit entry into the village.

The village needs to be protected. Most places need to be protected. The adults can’t hide how scared they are anymore... Something is wrong. The world is unsafe.

Pip can’t remember much from before things started getting bad, but they remember a few things. Things like rain. Pip used to love falling asleep to the sound of the nightly spring showers as they dripped on the roof of the little house Pip and their mom lived in. But it doesn’t rain anymore.

The neighborhood patrol went out of sight from Pip’s vantage point at their bedroom window.

The village was situated on what amounted to the edge of a cliff. Behind Pip’s house was a steep drop. The backyards of the houses across the street were a cliff face. A mountain village built along a strip of road.

But it was home.

Pip had finished their homework and was doodling absently at their desk when they had noticed the patrol go by. They looked silly wearing their stiff blue uniforms... It was out of place for the village. And Pip wasn’t sure the village really needed to be patrolled, anyway. What was the danger? Who would harm a town that lived under a sky this blue? Pip shook their head. It made no sense.

They doodled silly pictures of the neighborhood patrol. They made a little comic strip about them, too. At the bottom, Pip put their signature, a little four-leaf clover.

Pip closed their notebook and turned around.

There was something there.

[[Continue.-&gt;meeting the creature]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="meeting the creature" tags="" position="501,427">In the middle of Pip’s bedroom was standing a strange, tall, densely black, vaguely-humanoid mass. Two pure white eyes gleamed at Pip.

The creature had no mouth, but it spoke. “You,” it said, “and I.”

It stretched out its hand towards Pip. No, not its hand, it had no distinguishable hand, nor fingers, just more dense mass. The creature resembled a substantial shadow. It was like darkness had simply decided to terminate itself. The creature was like a boundary line.

The creature held out its arm.

[[Shake its “hand.”-&gt;becoming one]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="becoming one" tags="" position="501,577">Pip touched the creature’s arm, and it vanished. No. It was inside of Pip. Locked in their heart.

Pip felt doubled.

But they were not uncomfortable. Actually, it felt natural, normal. It was like an innocent secret.

Pip looked at themself in their mirror. Nothing seemed to be different. They closed their eyes. They visualized the creature.
To Pip’s surprise, the creature moved on its own. “I am here,” it said.

[[Continue.-&gt;creature 1]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="creature 1" tags="" position="501,726">“We are now together,” it said.

[[Continue.-&gt;creature 2]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="creature 2" tags="" position="501,877">“You will have to feed me,” it said.

<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="creature 3" tags="" position="501,1027">“You will come to understand,” it said.

[[Continue.-&gt;getting used to the idea]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="getting used to the idea" tags="" position="501,1177">Pip left their bedroom. Mom was cooking, so they went outside. It really was a beautiful day.

There weren’t many other children in the village. When Pip was bored, they liked to wander around the village. They were the only child allowed to do so. Their mom had said, “I trust you to stay safe and I trust the adults in the village to help keep you safe.” She didn’t have a job, but she didn’t have to go on patrols because if she did Pip would be all alone for a week--and without a teacher.

...So, there wasn’t much to do outside other than hope someone else was out or would let them in.

[[Walk towards the cordon.-&gt;meet Gabe]]
[[Walk towards the outskirts of town.-&gt;meet Juli]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="heading home" tags="" position="501,1302">They turned away and headed back towards their house. But first, suddenly, they saw the creature, as if in their mind’s eye.

“Ah... That man...” it said. “Some of the things he said, I can eat.”

“Eat?” Pip asked.

“Yes.” A few phrases materialized around the creature. I ALMOST WISH SOMETHING BAD WOULD HAPPEN. IT’S SILLY TO WEAR THESE UNIFORMS AND MARCH AROUND SUCH A QUIET PLACE. THE WORLD WAS ALWAYS A BAD PLACE. HOW SERIOUS CAN IT BE. IT’S HOME.

[[Continue.-&gt;coming to understand]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="coming to understand" tags="" position="501,1452">“I can eat these,” the creature said. “But, you have to choose which I eat.”

“Why?” Pip asked.

“...If you eat apples, you stay healthy. If you eat sweets, you get unhealthy. It’s the same for me. If I eat happy things, I grow happy. If I eat sad things, I grow sad. But, you need to feed me according to your own tastes.”

The creature paused.

“We have a lot we need to do together. You’ll need to keep me fed. But feeding me affects more than just me.

“You asked why you need to choose what I eat. That’s because we are now together.” The creature stopped talking and waited.

[[Feed the creature.-&gt;first feeding]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="first feeding" tags="" position="501,1602">Pip selected a couple of the phrases, which the creature seemed to absorb into itself. Its body, such as it was, seemed to change a little... but it was hard to tell exactly how.

“Phrases, drawings, songs, I eat things like that,” the creature said. “If I don’t eat, I’ll fade away. And so will you...”
Pip said nothing.

“...There is an old, burned house in the woods just outside the village,” the creature said. “I don’t know much. All I know is that we need to go there. Do you feel it too?”

Pip realized they felt, deep down inside of them, a strange, intense, yearning pull towards the woods... Pip nodded.

“We need to get there, very soon.”

The creature faded away.

The pull remained.

[[Continue.-&gt;continuing home]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="11" name="continuing home" tags="" position="502,1755">Pip resumed their walk back home. The sky was starting to get a little orange, but there were still a few hours of daylight left.
Nobody was outside today... That was usual, but it always made Pip a little sad.

They shook the pair of dice they kept in their pocket, then gripped them, tightly. Then they let go. They felt a little better.

Pip returned home and went inside. Mom was still cooking. They approached her.

Mom glanced at Pip, then looked at them again with noticeably more scrutiny.

“You seem a little different, dear,” she said. “Did something happen?”

“Um, I don’t think so...” Pip said. They thought for a second. “Or, maybe?”

Mom focused her attention on her child. “What happened?”

[[Tell Mom about the creature.-&gt;telling Mom about the creature]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="telling Mom about the creature" tags="" position="502,1905">“Earlier, I met something in my room.” Pip did their best to explain the creature, how it seemed to cohabit their body. Mom looked very concerned.

“Should I take you to see a doctor?”

Pip shook their head. “I feel fine.”

Mom scratched her head. “I’ve heard,” she started, seemed to immediately regret it, but continued anyway, “about a lot of strange things happening ever since a few years ago. Maybe whatever’s happening to the world has found its way to you.”

Pip didn’t know what to say. Then they remembered what they needed to say.

“I need to go into the woods.”

“No.”

“Please, Mom.”

Mom returned to her cooking. “It’s too dangerous and you know it. Whatever it is you need to go to the woods for, it’s not as important as your safety.”

“...I don’t want to go, Mom. I need to go.”

“That’s what it is,” Mom said, not looking at Pip. “You do look different. Somehow more worldly. Just a little.” She sighed. “Fine. But only, and I mean only, if you can get an adult to take you. Do you understand me?”

Pip nodded.

They knew Mom wanted to say more, but she didn’t. She didn’t have to... Pip knew.

[[Get ready to leave.-&gt;getting ready to leave]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="getting ready to leave" tags="" position="501,2056">STRANGE THINGS. WHATEVER’S HAPPENING TO THIS WORLD HAS FOUND ITS WAY TO YOU. IT’S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS YOUR SAFETY. Pip chose a few phrases and fed the creature.

Pip went to their room and got their backpack. They put a few snacks inside of it, as well as a flashlight and a light jacket. They grabbed a small baseball bat and put on their cap.

They looked at themself in the mirror. They did look a little different, in a way Pip couldn’t describe. Worldly...? They weren’t sure what that meant. Did they want to look more like a dangerous world?

Pip tried to visualize the creature to talk to it, but they realized they were just stalling. They were scared to go into the woods.

They quietly left home.

[[Find Gabe.-&gt;find Gabe]]
[[Find Juli.-&gt;find Juli]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="find Gabe" tags="" position="363,2200">Pip returned to where they had earlier spoken with Gabe. Gabe was trying hard to look like he was asleep. But he seemed to notice Pip approaching from a bit of a distance and gave himself away.
“Hey, kid,” he said, “I thought I said you should get home.”

“I need you to take me to the burned house in the woods,” Pip said.

“You need me to take you to the burned house in--what? Why?”

Pip shrugged. “I don’t know.”

Gabe scratched his head. He squatted down so he could look at Pip face-to-face. “Why do you want to go into the woods?”

“I don’t want to. I just know that I have to,” Pip explained.

Gabe sighed. “Well, get used to that feeling, kid. That’s life.” He slowly stood up and stretched as if he really had just woken up. “You look different,” he said, just like Mom. “Not like everyone else in this town. Tough.” Gabe yawned.

“Let me let the rest of the patrol know I’m escorting someone,” he said. He procured a walkie-talkie from somewhere in his uniform and turned away from Pip to quietly make his communication.

[[Continue.-&gt;feeding 1]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="feeding 1" tags="" position="362,2358">GET USED TO THAT FEELING THAT’S LIFE. Pip made a decision...

[[Continue.-&gt;leaving with Gabe]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="leaving with Gabe" tags="" position="362,2511">“Okay,” Gabe said, “they’re letting me take you to the woods.” He started to rearrange the cordon to allow the pair to pass through. “Just, hey kid, you gotta stick close to me, and you gotta do everything I say, and if things get dangerous, we’re coming back here, like, immediately. Got it?” They passed through the cordon, which Gabe again rearranged. Pip nodded.

“Thank you for taking me to the woods, Mr. Gabe,” Pip said.

Gabe laughed a little. “Please don’t call me that, kid. I’m not so beaten down that I believe in titles like that.”

They set off towards the woods. “What do you mean?” Pip asked.

“I just mean that, yeah, life is weird and bad, and my life has been weird and bad, but the world still hasn’t been so bad to me that it’s gotten me to think that, ah,” he paused, trying to think of a good way to explain it to a child, “that weird, fake ways of showing respect mean anything. It’s more like, it’s not you showing respect, it’s other people asserting their dominance over you. So I don’t like when people treat me like I’m ‘respectable.’ You know?”

Pip considered this. “So, you think of everyone as a friend?”

They rounded a slight curve in the road and could see the woods not far away. “That’s not a bad way of putting it,” Gabe said, “but it turns out it’s not a great way to make friends.”

“You don’t have friends?”

“Oh, hey, I forgot to ask,” Gabe said. “What’s your name, kid?”

“I’m Pip.”

“Oh. Right. Yeah.”

“Maybe you don’t have friends because you’re like that.”

“Listen, kid,” Gabe sighed, “we’re all just trying to survive, and we gotta find our own ways to do it. Doesn’t matter if you live in Utopia or... this world of ours. It’s all the same.”

They had reached the edge of the woods.

“Pip,” Gabe said, “hold my hand so we don’t get separated.”

“...No.” Pip went into the woods. Gabe followed after a few seconds, then overtook them, leading the way.

“I thought I was in charge here, kid,” Gabe complained. He grumbled under his breath about uniforms not meaning anything these days, and what’s with kids, and what the hell, since when were the woods this black and weird, why were no birds singing...

[[Feed.-&gt;feeding 2]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="17" name="feeding 2" tags="" position="364,2653">NOT SO BEATEN DOWN. DON’T BELIEVE IN TITLES. LIFE IS WEIRD AND BAD.

JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE IN OUR OWN WAYS DOESN’T MATTER IF YOU’RE IN UTOPIA OR IN THIS WORLD. Pip had to take a while to choose what to feed and what not. The creature’s physical appearance was definitely changing... It seemed a little more hunched over.

Gabe and Pip made their way through the woods. Fallen trees and dead, stiff brush made the going slow. Everything seemed to be rotting... The woods were getting reclaimed by fungi and weeds. It seemed a lively place for detritivores and nothing else.

[[Continue.-&gt;the tree]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="18" name="the tree" tags="" position="441,2801">“Oh, this is...” Gabe stopped to look at a tree. The trunk was massive, easily three or four times the size of any other tree in the woods. Hideous, jagged cracks were splitting its bark, and vines were crawling up it.

“Do you know about this tree?” Gabe asked Pip. Pip shook their head.

Gabe chuckled emptily. “Get closer, take a look.” The sunlight was beginning to grow dim, so Pip got their flashlight and shone it on the trunk. They could see pairs of names carved into the bark, with the designs of hearts or knots or locks joining the pairs.

“Used to be,” Gabe said, “young couples would come to this tree and carve their names in it. They thought, ‘This is the oldest tree in the woods, and as long as it lives, so will our relationship.’” He spat on the ground and chuckled again, bitterly this time.

“...What’s wrong?” Pip asked. “Did you ever carve your name here?” They saw the weird cracking splitting many of the names and pairs...

“Believe it or not, kid, I did. But then some other people saw our names and crossed them out.”

“Why?”

“They said, ‘This tree isn’t for people like you.’ Tch. The tree isn’t here for anyone. It’s here for itself. By the looks of things, right now it’s here to die.”

Gabe looked in the direction of the village. “By all means, enjoy your tree...” His bitterness masked an anger Pip could only barely detect. An anger and a fear.

[[“What happened to your girlfriend?”-&gt;gf test]]
[[&quot;Do you think if the tree dies, everyone will separate?&quot;-&gt;tree test]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="19" name="gf test" tags="" position="505,2936">“What happened to your girlfriend?” Pip asked.

“...We should get going,” Gabe said. “Sorry I got distracted.” He started walking again. “The house shouldn’t be far from here...”

Pip kept looking at the tree. Oh... There were their parents’ names. But their Dad had died before they were born... They jogged to catch up with Gabe.

[[Ask again.-&gt;gf press]]

<tw-passagedata pid="20" name="tree test" tags="" position="654,2937">“Will everyone separate if the tree dies?” Pip asked.

“Nah,” Gabe said dismissively. “The tree doesn’t keep people together, you know? People do.” He shrugged at his own phrasing.

“Hey, we should keep going... Make use of the light we have left.” He continued walking into the woods.

Pip kept looking at the tree. Oh... There were their parents’ names. But their Dad had died before they were born... They jogged to catch up with Gabe.

“Boyfriend,” Gabe said, reluctantly. “We split up.”

“Why?”

“He told me it was because of the tree.”

They were silent for a while.

“Sorry,” Gabe apologized. “I should be more, hm, responsible, and stop talking about myself.” He laughed lightly. “You don’t wanna hear about some strange old dummy’s worldviews.”

But, Pip did. And besides, so did the creature.

(else:)[AS LONG AS IT LIVES, SO WILL OUR RELATIONSHIP. SAW OUR NAMES AND CROSSED THEM OUT. ISN’T FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU. ISN’T HERE FOR ANYONE. IT’S HERE FOR ITSELF. IT’S HERE TO DIE.] Pip diligently picked phrases to feed the creature as they continued to follow Gabe through the woods.

&quot;What is it you&#39;re looking for, anyway?&quot; Gabe asked. &quot;Like, why am I being dragged to the burned house?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Pip answered. &quot;I think I&#39;ll know it when I see it.&quot;

Gabe&#39;s slouch increased. &quot;There&#39;s nothing there, kid.&quot;

&quot;Why are you taking me there, then?&quot; Pip was surprised to hear a little harshness in their voice. Gabe didn&#39;t seem to notice.

&quot;Change of pace,&quot; he said. &quot;I like walking. I like doing small tasks. I like changes of scenery. I like the woods. Take your pick.&quot;

It was getting dark. The pair paused to get their flashlights out.

&quot;You&#39;ve been in the woods a lot,&quot; Pip said.

Gabe shrugged. &quot;When you&#39;re a kid in that village, it&#39;s the only place to go. Well, it used to be.&quot; He looked around him. &quot;But when you do something like that, it just becomes an extension of home.&quot;

Pip looked around, too. &quot;Is that a bad thing?&quot;

&quot;Depends on if you like home.&quot;

&quot;Do you like home?&quot;

Gabe sighed. &quot;Kid, seeing that tree&#39;s put me in a bad mood. So I&#39;ll put it this way: I&#39;d rather be back there than in here right now. And I&#39;d much rather be there than at that... house. But I don&#39;t like letting people down. So let&#39;s just make it quick, okay?&quot;

Pip was silent.

[[Continue.-&gt;arriving at the house]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="23" name="arriving at the house" tags="" position="655,3236">WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT JUST BECOMES AN EXTENSION OF HOME. DEPENDS ON IF YOU LIKE HOME.

...Eventually, Gabe and Pip arrived at what Pip assumed to be the burned house. It was less a burned house than a charred concrete foundation. It was entirely out of place. Some rotten, destroyed wood clung almost stubbornly to the foundation. There was no discernible remaining trace of any of the house&#39;s former layout, if it had any. Actually, nothing even suggested the place had been a house. If Pip hadn&#39;t known, they might not even have guessed it was once a house. And it was such a distance from the village... What exactly was this place?

When the wreck came into view, Gabe stopped walking and leaned against a nearby tree with his arms crossed. &quot;Well, here it is, kid,&quot; he said. He looked at his watch. &quot;We gotta leave soon. Ten minutes and we&#39;re going back, okay?&quot;

Pip realized that Gabe was, in fact, serious about all of this.

&quot;What was this place?&quot; they asked.

&quot;Some guy&#39;s house. Burned down. Guy died.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you like it here?&quot;

Gabe sighed and didn&#39;t answer. So Pip moved toward the ruin... As they got nearer, the weird pull they felt deep within them got powerfully stronger, but also wound around them, like it was binding Pip in a knot. It felt like they were going to throw up.

[[They explored the burned house.-&gt;exploring the house]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="24" name="exploring the house" tags="" position="655,3386">There wasn&#39;t much to see. Nothing was left at all. But Pip knew they needed to be here and find something.

As they paced quietly around the foundation, they started noticing some things they hadn&#39;t noticed before. There seemed to be some trash, like discarded water bottles and the like, littered around nearby. A lot of the garbage was covered with dirt, and was unearthed, so to speak, only when Pip stepped on it or kicked it. Nearby trees, like the huge one a while back, had names and other words written in them. Pip guessed this too had been a popular destination for the kids of the village... They couldn&#39;t understand why, though.

The garbage was the only interesting thing, however. Nothing Pip saw gave any indication of being what they had gone all that way to see.

Until they saw it.

They swept their flashlight over a pile of collapsed wood, and noticed, somehow, a hinge... The place had a basement. That was it, Pip felt. It was down there.

They tried to moved the collapsed wood. It took a lot of pushing, but they were able to manage to move some... Gabe noticed and jogged over. &quot;Hey, hey, let me,&quot; he said gently. Pip stood back as Gabe shifted the wreckage. When he was done, he looked at the tiny square hatch that hh had revealed. He scratched his head. &quot;Huh. How did this not burn?&quot; he wondered aloud.

&quot;How did nobody notice it until now?&quot; Pip also wondered.

&quot;That&#39;s a good question,&quot; Gabe said, his curiosity piqued. &quot;I have some guesses, but... it looks almost like it was hidden.&quot;

&quot;What makes you say that?&quot;

&quot;The whole place is wrecked but here&#39;s a perfect pile of wood atop the door to the basement? Or, whatever it is. Come to think of it,&quot; Gabe continued, &quot;concrete? A concrete foundation for a house in the woods? How??&quot;

Gabe seemed very stressed about the concrete.

Pip opened the hatch door.

[[Continue.-&gt;into the basement]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="25" name="into the basement" tags="" position="655,3536">Opening the hatch snapped Gabe out of his despair.

&quot;OH,&quot; he shouted, startled. &quot;Let me go first. It might not be safe.&quot;

Gabe peered into the darkness, then shone his flashlight down. &quot;Don&#39;t see anything,&quot; he said. He waved the flashlight around a little. &quot;Nope. No ladder. But it&#39;s not deep...&quot;

He handed Pip his flashlight. &quot;Here, hold this steady, okay?&quot; Gabe slid down the hatch. &quot;Okay, hand it back to me.&quot; Pip gave him the flashlight. His hands were just about in reach.

Pip watched him examine the basement. &quot;All I see is a few books and a painting. That mean anything to you, kid?&quot;

&quot;Not really...&quot;

Gabe was silent for a few moments. He disappeared out of Pip&#39;s view. After a few seconds, Pip could see the flashlight light again. Gabe was setting it up so he could see and be seen from the hatch. He returned and held out his arms toward Pip.

&quot;Be careful, okay?&quot; he said.

Pip sat so their legs dangled into the hatch. They used their arms to push their body forward slowly, then dropped lightly into Gabe&#39;s arms. Gabe lowered them to the floor as gently as he could and let go. He retrieved his flashlight...

Pip looked around. It was only barely a basement. It smelled of earth and ash.

There was a small bookcase with a few books. On the opposite wall hung a medium-sized painting. That was it.

Pip looked at the painting. It was strange... It seemed angry. It was a bunch of red and blue blurs smeared on canvas.

Pip looked at the books. Most of them were collections of paintings. They looked worn but loved. Only two of the books were different; both appeared to be journals.

Pip felt a sudden tug on their heart. These journals. They were here for something in these journals.

Gabe noticed how intently Pip was staring at the journals. He wanted to suggest they take them and leave, but stopped himself. Pip did not seem available. Had their appearance changed again...? They seemed a little harsh somehow.

[[Read a journal.-&gt;first journal]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="26" name="first journal" tags="" position="655,3686">Pip leafed through one of the journals. Almost every page was blank. Pip went to the first page. It read:

&quot;I lost it. At some point I lost it. I can&#39;t paint anymore.

&quot;I can&#39;t paint anymore. Do I even exist if I can&#39;t paint?

&quot;If I can&#39;t paint, I don&#39;t want to exist.

&quot;I&#39;ll just leave the books and the last good thing I made.

&quot;I&#39;ll burn everything else.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mom and Dad. Thank you for believing in me. I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot;

That was all.

The words swam in Pip&#39;s head.

The creature appeared. Pip had to see some of those words again.

I CAN&#39;T PAINT ANYMORE. DO I EVEN EXIST IF I CAN&#39;T PAINT. IF I CAN&#39;T PAINT I DON&#39;T WANT TO EXIST. THE LAST GOOD THING I MADE. BURN EVERYTHING ELSE. THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING IN ME. I&#39;LL SEE YOU SOON.

Pip didn&#39;t know what to do...

...

Pip made their decisions and fed the creature. They closed the journal and placed it back on the shelf.

So, the second one had to be it.

[[Open the second journal.-&gt;second journal]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="27" name="second journal" tags="" position="653,3835">The second journal looked almost identical to the first. But when Pip leafed through it, they saw it was lousy with writing. It all seemed almost haphazard... It was a distinctly different hand from the one in the other journal. There were a lot of weird diagrams and symbols and designs... Numbers and equations, too. What was this thing?

Pip tried to read it but the writing was entirely illegible. Pip couldn&#39;t even make out any letters, or at least none they recognized. They scanned the journal quickly. The only thing they could read was toward the end... right below a drawing of the creature.

Pip could hear the creature&#39;s voice. &quot;What is this...?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know?&quot; Pip asked it.

&quot;...All I knew was we needed to come here. And I don&#39;t know how I knew that.&quot;

Pip read what they could.

&quot;I&#39;m certain of it. Soon the world will start dying. Nothing can save it. But when the god above appears before the Slate Child... that will be the world&#39;s one chance. Its one chance to be remade.

&quot;The god and child will remake the world... They will make a new world. When this world&#39;s end draws near, the path to the gate of creation will open... They&#39;ll go there, and make a new world.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Gabe said. Pip noticed he was standing over their shoulder, reading as well. How long had he been there...?

&quot;So that&#39;s what happened to this place,&quot; he said. He looked at the painting. Pip looked at him, at the back of his head. &quot;The world&#39;s ending, huh?&quot; Gabe continued. &quot;And I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re the one who&#39;s gonna make, what, a new world?&quot; Pip was silent. Gabe turned to face Pip. He squatted down to look Pip directly in the eyes.

Gabe&#39;s voice was so quiet it was nearly a whisper. &quot;What do you think? Do you believe that thing?&quot;

Pip nodded.

&quot;So you&#39;ve met this... &#39;god?&#39;&quot;

Pip nodded again.

&quot;Do me a favor,&quot; Gabe said, &quot;and tell it it owes me for all it&#39;s done to me.&quot; He was not smiling. He was silent.

Pip wanted to know something. &quot;Do you believe what it says?&quot;

Gabe&#39;s expression changed from one complicated one to another. &quot;I think I do,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;ve heard about a lot of the stuff going on, right? It&#39;s unsustainable. Everything&#39;s dying.&quot;

He suddenly became earnest.

&quot;I don&#39;t think this world&#39;s worth your effort, kid. Pip. But you&#39;re not saving this one, you&#39;re making a new one. ...That&#39;s what you&#39;re gonna do, right? You&#39;re gonna make a new world?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what it says...&quot;

Gabe shook his head. &quot;I mean, you want to do it, right? Make a new world?&quot;

Pip nodded a third time. &quot;You said that people do what they do to survive. So that means it&#39;s worth it to survive, right? Then it&#39;s worth it to try to save people.&quot;

&quot;...I don&#39;t disagree with you but,&quot; Gabe&#39;s voice trailed off.

He fell backwards and sat on the ground. He pulled the brim of his hat low over his face. He shook slightly. ...He was sobbing.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Pip asked.

Gabe&#39;s voice was unsteady. &quot;I just didn&#39;t realize until now that I thought that way. That people are worth saving. And that maybe that means I should be doing more than what I am with my life...&quot; He slowly got himself together and laughed, embarrassed. &quot;Sorry about that.&quot; He smiled at Pip. &quot;You&#39;ve got enough to worry about, right?&quot;

He stood and patted Pip on the back.

&quot;Let&#39;s get back to the village, okay?&quot;

They returned to the hatch. Gabe lifted Pip up to the opening. Pip was able to easily pull themself up. Gabe, with a nice jump, was able to pull himself up as well. He made Pip promise not to help him. When they were both back aboveground, he looked at his watch. &quot;...Ah. We better hurry.&quot; He squatted, facing away from Pip. &quot;Hop on,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re gonna run.&quot;

...Was he serious.

&quot;I&#39;m serious, Pip. Your mom&#39;s probably worried about you.&quot;

Ah. Pip leapt onto Gabe&#39;s back. Gabe grunted a little, but he stood up. He grabbed Pip&#39;s legs. &quot;Hold on tight, and keep the flashlight as steady as you can,&quot; he said.

Despite themself--despite EVERYTHING--Pip smiled the whole time they dashed through the woods. It was a lot of fun...!

They felt grateful for Gabe.

[[Feed.-&gt;feeding 4]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="28" name="feeding 4" tags="" position="653,3986">(THE PAINTING). THE WORLD WILL START DYING. NOTHING CAN SAVE IT. THE GOD. THE SLATE CHILD. REMAKE THE WORLD. CREATION. NEW WORLD. THAT&#39;S WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE. YOU&#39;RE THE ONE WHO&#39;S GONNA MAKE A NEW WORLD. GOD OWES ME FOR ALL IT&#39;S DONE TO ME. IT&#39;S UNSUSTAINABLE EVERYTHING&#39;S DYING. I DON&#39;T THINK THIS WORLD&#39;S WORTH YOUR EFFORT. PIP. YOU&#39;RE MAKING A NEW ONE. I DON&#39;T DISAGREE WITH YOU. I DIDN&#39;T REALIZE UNTIL NOW THAT I THOUGHT THAT WAY. PEOPLE ARE WORTH SAVING. I SHOULD DO SOMETHING MORE WITH MY LIFE. (GABE&#39;S SMILE). YOU&#39;VE GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT. YOUR MOM&#39;S PROBABLY WORRIED.

There wasn&#39;t much to think about. Pip was going to remake the world. They didn&#39;t know what that meant. They believed the creature didn&#39;t know either.

They just had to tell Mom.

Pip and Gabe returned to the village not exactly late, but at least well after nighttime had set in. The tall streetlights were lit, giving the whole village a soft, ethereal glow. Everything was half-doubled in blue mirages. Pip wondered what constellations they could see... But they also wondered what it would matter.

What mattered was whatever it was they had to do.

Gabe stopped to arrange the cordon to allow for passage. Another member of the neighborhood patrol, who had taken Gabe&#39;s posted, seemed entirely shocked by what she saw. Gabe ignored her. Once he was through the cordon, he continued running. &quot;Let me know when we get to your house,&quot; he told Pip. He seemed on the verge of running out of energy.

Pip stopped him in front of their house. Gabe let them off his back. But before Pip could head inside, Gabe stopped them, remaining squatting to once again speak to Pip directly. Or, it seemed that&#39;s what he wanted to do, but he changed his mind. &quot;Just be safe, Pip,&quot; he said. &quot;See you around.&quot;

Pip turned their back on Gabe. They went inside their house.

[[Continue.-&gt;returning home]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="29" name="returning home" tags="" position="653,4136">Mom was already there, waiting.

She didn&#39;t say anything. Pip didn&#39;t say anything.

She looked at them.

She went to the kitchen table and sat down. Pip followed her and sat down as well. There was a sandwich at their place in the table.

Mom said, &quot;You&#39;re going to tell me something, something I&#39;m going to hate, I know it.&quot;

Mom said, &quot;I want you to eat first. You&#39;re going to leave me, so I want to make sure you eat first.&quot;

Pip picked up the sandwich. It was their favorite kind. They took a bite. It tasted like home.

Pip thought that if they remade the world, everything would change. That home would change too. That they and the village and Mom would change.

Pip kept eating. They wanted to cry, but they knew if they did, Mom would never let them leave.

They finished the sandwich.

&quot;So it&#39;s true,&quot; Mom said, &quot;you&#39;re going to leave me.&quot;

Pip didn&#39;t move.

Mom was crying.

Pip stood up and walked over to her. They hugged her. She hugged them.

They didn&#39;t need to speak to each other.

[[Continue.-&gt;last preparations]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="30" name="last preparations" tags="" position="653,4261">Pip went to their room to add a few things to their backpack, like extra flashlight batteries and some clothes. They didn&#39;t know exactly what they would need. Money? Or would things just resolve themselves? And how would they travel? Where did they need to go?

They left their room and went back to Mom. She wasn&#39;t crying anymore.

&quot;Pip,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m going to give you some money. And I&#39;ve packed you some food. But you need to make me a promise. Promise me that you&#39;ll never travel alone, and you&#39;ll never travel with someone you don&#39;t trust.&quot;

&quot;I promise, Mom.&quot;

Mom handed Pip some money and food, which they put in their backpack.

&quot;I mean it,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#39;re not even to leave this village without someone escorting you.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

Pip had a few questions.

&quot;Why can&#39;t you come with me?&quot;

Mom looked at Pip again.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but you&#39;ve changed, in just a few hours, you&#39;ve changed... Maybe it&#39;s that creature.&quot; She paused. &quot;But something is telling me that this is something that you have to do yourself. As much as I wish I could go with you, as terribly as I&#39;ll feel not knowing whether you&#39;re safe, I just know that I can&#39;t.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;I know that I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot; Pip didn&#39;t really understand. &quot;Um, do you know about anything that sounds like a path being opened, like, when the world started getting worse?&quot;

Mom was very confused.

&quot;A path to what being opened??&quot;

&quot;Um, creation?&quot;

&quot;Uh. No. I don&#39;t think so.&quot; Mom looked even more worried.

&quot;Okay. Thank you, Mom.&quot;

Pip started to leave.

&quot;I love you, Pip. Never forget that.&quot;

&quot;I love you too, Mom. I never will.&quot;

[[Leave.-&gt;leave home]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="31" name="leave home" tags="" position="654,4410">For what they guessed would be the last time, Pip left their house.

Oh... the creature seemed hungry. Pip decided it was time to feed it.

<tw-passagedata pid="33" name="meet Gabe" tags="" position="376,1327">Pip walked down the street, but nobody seemed available. They walked up to the cordon. A tallish, youngish man was standing guard, theoretically. He was actually just leaning against the sawhorses and trying to stay awake.

Gabe. Gabe was a laborer of some sort, but really he did everything. Doing odd jobs suited him. Pip guessed that was because he was odd.

Not a whole lot of people in the village liked Gabe. Consensus seemed to be that he had a bad attitude. But it was agreed that he was trustworthy. Not that anyone would jump at the chance to trust him with something.

Gabe noticed Pip approaching, which startled him awake. “Oh! Sorry, you can’t past here,” he informed Pip. “Um, it’s dangerous...”

Pip looked at him. They looked around at the village. “Is it? What’s dangerous?” they asked.

Gabe fidgeted. “Ah. You know.” He shrugged. “They say the last few years, like, the rain stopped, and there’s no food, and gangs of criminals control the cities or something.”

“Nothing like that’s happened here.”

“Nah, not at all.” Gabe sighed. “I almost wish something bad would happen. It’s silly to wear these uniforms and march around such a quiet place...”

Pip looked at Gabe inquisitively.

Gabe shrugged again. “I feel like, the world was always a bad place, but if it’s so much worse, shouldn’t it be affecting a place like this too? But it’s not. So how serious can it be... But we patrol,” he snapped to attention, exaggeratedly, “and keep the village safe!”

...He leaned back against the sawhorses.

Pip kept looking at him. “Do you like the village,” they asked.
Gabe pulled the brim of his hat down over his eyes and crossed his arms. “It’s home. Speaking of which, you should get to yours. For your own safety, citizen!” He made a super serious face and saluted. Pip smiled, just a little.

[[Continue.-&gt;heading home]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="34" name="meet Juli" tags="" position="630,1318">Pip headed the shorter way towards the outskirts of town, beyond which was nothing but more highway that, for all Pip knew, stretched infinitely towards nothing.

As they approached the cordon, Pip noticed a couple people guarding it. It was hard to tell, but they seemed disciplined. They were positioned at either side of the cordon, one facing towards the highway, with her back towards the town, the other facing Pip. Pip noticed her watching them as they approached; when they got within a few yards of the cordon, she raised her hand and ordered them to halt.

This startled the other guard, who slowly turned around, as the imperious guard began to interrogate Pip.

&quot;What business do you have outside the village?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;I have none,&quot; Pip answered.

&quot;Then why are you trying to leave?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not.&quot;

The other guard, who had long blonde hair and a kind face, smiled at Pip reassuringly. &quot;Kris,&quot; she said in a diplomatic tone, &quot;not everyone&#39;s a threat, you know.&quot;

&quot;We have a duty,&quot; Kris responded curtly. &quot;No exceptions. Not even for kids.&quot;

The other guard seemed momentarily exasperated, then looked back at Pip. &quot;Is something the matter?&quot; she asked, &quot;Or is there something you need?&quot;

Ah, Pip recognized her now. She was Juli, who had gone off to college and come back to be a schoolteacher around the time the schools closed.

&quot;Nothing&#39;s the matter,&quot; Pip replied, &quot;I just wanted to find someone to talk to.&quot;

Juli smiled down at Pip, then smiled in a different way at Kris. &quot;See?&quot; she said, &quot;Just a lonely child.&quot;

Kris seemed dissatisfied, but also unwilling to challenge Juli. She kept her eyes locked on Pip.

Pip, however, was a little indignant. &quot;I&#39;m not a lonely child,&quot; they said, &quot;I just want to talk.&quot;

&quot;Well, what about?&quot; Juli asked.

&quot;Is it true the world&#39;s going bad?&quot;

Juli considered this. &quot;Well, there&#39;s a lot of weird things going on, but it seems everything is being taken care of, so there&#39;s no need to worry.&quot; Her tone was measured.

&quot;Everyone here is worried about a food shortage, I think...&quot; Pip started, but they were interrupted.

&quot;There&#39;s a lot of short-term concerns, yeah,&quot; Juli said, &quot;but the authorities are making sure that in the long run, everyone will be just fine. So there&#39;s nothing to worry about, okay? I mean, just look at us. A few years ago, neither of us could&#39;ve even dreamed we&#39;d be carrying weapons and protecting a city, but here we are doing it. That&#39;s because it&#39;s adults&#39; jobs to make sure everyone is safe and happy.&quot;

Pip looked at Kris, whose expression remained unchanged. Noticing this, Juli told Kris to say something herself.

&quot;...I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to protect this village,&quot; she said.

A long pause.

&quot;And?&quot; Juli asked.

&quot;That&#39;s all,&quot; Kris said.

Juli sighed.

&quot;You&#39;re... Pip, right? You should get home soon. Your mom&#39;s gotta be worried about you.&quot;

&quot;Right...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s another adult doing her best to keep you safe, okay?&quot; Juli said, &quot;So make sure you thank her by staying safe.&quot;

Pip turned around slowly and went back towards home.

[[Continue.--&gt;heading home]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="35" name="find Juli" tags="" position="647,2197">Pip returned to where they had earlier spoken with Juli. Juli was facing the village this time, on the opposite side of the cordon as before; Kris was facing the highway. She was utterly motionless.

Juli frowned as Pip approached. &quot;It&#39;s still light out,&quot; she began, sighing, &quot;but it&#39;s gonna be dark soon, so you should really be home right now...&quot; She noticed Pip&#39;s backpack. &quot;Hm? You seem a little more... how to put it... needy? than a while ago.&quot;

Pip frowned a little. &quot;Could you please take me to the burned house in the woods?&quot;

That caught her off-guard. &quot;What? No. No way. Way too dangerous.&quot;

&quot;Please, Ms. Juli. I need to go to the burned house.&quot;

Juli perked up. &quot;Why do you need to go there?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s something important I have to do there, I think.&quot;

Pip was resolute.

Unexpectedly, Kris interposed, without turning to face either Juli or Pip. &quot;The neighborhood patrol is not a prison staff. We are bound to protect the village&#39;s residents. If one needs and escort, it is our duty to grant it.&quot;

Juli was speechless for a few moments, then tried to collect herself. &quot;That may be, but we&#39;re not bound to follow a child&#39;s whims.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a whim,&quot; Pip protested. &quot;I need to go there.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll go,&quot; Kris said. Juli immediately balked.

&quot;No no no, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take you,&quot; Juli shouted. &quot;It&#39;ll be a fun little adventure, right?&quot; she said indulgently to Pip.

&quot;I&#39;ll keep watch here,&quot; Kris said.

&quot;Shocking,&quot; Juli said sarcastically. She put on a smile for Pip. &quot;Well, let&#39;s go!&quot;

...

As they walked towards the other end of the village, Juli spoke into a walkie-talkie to inform the others that she was leaving to escort someone into the woods. By the time she was finished, the pair had approached the opposite cordon. Gabe was leaning against the sawhorses, arms crossed, smirking a little at Juli.

&quot;Going to the woods, huh?&quot; he asked derisively.

&quot;Hmph. At least I know what that&#39;s like,&quot; Juli nearly spat.

Gabe began rearranging the cordon so Juli and Pip could pass through it. &quot;Aha, if that&#39;s so, then I&#39;m glad the woods and I are strangers.&quot; After he was finished and allowed Pip and Juli to pass through, he said, &quot;If only you and I could be strangers too, huh?&quot;

&quot;Oh, but Gabe,&quot; Juli said, feigning sweetness, &quot;without you, school would have been so much more dull.&quot;

&quot;I can believe that,&quot; Gabe retorted, a faint smile on his face. He tipped his hat to Pip, then started replacing the cordon. &quot;Be careful out there, kid,&quot; Gabe shouted after them. Juli shook her head in disgust.

[[Continue.-&gt;leaving with Juli]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="37" name="leaving with Juli" tags="" position="647,2497">Juli and Pip hurried to the edge of the woods and entered. Juli seemed to be in a rush.

&quot;Do you not like being out of the village?&quot; Pip asked.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not safe,&quot; Juli answered.

Pip wasn&#39;t so sure.

The going was slow because the forest was covered in thick, dead brush. The pair made their way carefully, Pip following Juli&#39;s lead, to what they guessed was a burned house.

&quot;So, there&#39;s really a burned house in these woods?&quot; Pip asked.

Juli chuckled a little.</tw-passagedata>
